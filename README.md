# sp — Daily Scratchpad

CLI/TUI scratchpad for daily notes, todos, and quick thoughts. Built
with Go and the [charm.sh](https://charm.sh) toolchain.

## Features

- Daily scratchpad: a fresh page per day, kept on disk forever
- Three view modes that drill into one another:
  - Year / month calendar with per-day previews and entry sparklines
  - Notebook viewer with glamour-rendered markdown, scrubbable across
    pages
  - External editor (`$EDITOR`) for actually writing
- One semantic rule across the TUI: **Enter goes deeper**
- Inline editing: hand the editor to `tea.ExecProcess`, save on exit,
  resume the same view with a refreshed render — no shell hop between
  edits
- Light / dark palette swap driven by your terminal: `Ctrl+T` toggles
  in-session, `SIGUSR1` re-detects, macOS appearance changes are
  picked up automatically via an fsnotify watcher on the global
  preferences plist
- Glyph set choice: nerd-font icons or pure-ASCII fallback, set in
  `~/.sp/config.toml`
- Opt-in day templates: append one or more named Markdown sections from
  files or script output, with a built-in workday timeboxing helper

## Installation

### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap pders01/sp
brew install sp
```

### Build from source

Requires Go 1.24 or later.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pders01/sp.git
cd sp
make install   # → $GOPATH/bin/sp
```

Or manually:

```sh
go build -o sp ./cmd/sp
```

## Usage

```sh
sp          # open today's page in $EDITOR
sp -n       # notebook viewer; Enter / e / i opens the editor
sp -c       # calendar; Enter drills into the notebook on that day
sp --version
```

### Flow

```
sp -c   →   calendar   ──Enter──→   notebook   ──Enter/e/i──→   editor
                ▲ ▲                     │                          │
                │ └────── Esc ──────────┘                          │
                │                                                  │
                └─────── editor exits, view resumes ───────────────┘
            (Calendar 'e' is a power-user shortcut: skip the notebook
             and edit the picked day immediately.)
```

After the editor saves and exits, the active view repaints with the
updated content. Pop from notebook back to calendar with `Esc`/
`Backspace`; the calendar cursor follows wherever you were in the
notebook.

## Configuration

Optional TOML at `~/.sp/config.toml`. Missing fields fall back to the
defaults shown in `config.example.toml`:

```toml
[ui]
icons = "unicode"   # or "nerd" if you have a Nerd Font installed
theme = "auto"      # "auto" | "light" | "dark"

[templates]
allow_commands = false

[[templates.items]]
name = "Meeting notes"
file = "~/.sp/templates/meeting.md"

# Requires allow_commands = true above.
[[templates.items]]
name = "Issue tracker"
command = ["/path/to/issue-template", "--markdown"]
```

`auto` resolves via `GLAMOUR_STYLE` → `COLORFGBG` → terminal
detection → macOS `AppleInterfaceStyle`. Send `SIGUSR1` (`pkill -USR1
sp`) to re-detect after a manual switch.

Press `a` on a day to open the multi-select template chooser. Markdown files
and command stdout become separate `##` sections; commands receive the selected
date in `SP_DATE`. Relative Markdown file paths resolve from the directory that
contains `config.toml`. Existing content is only appended to, never replaced.
Applied template IDs are stored in scratchpad JSON metadata to prevent duplicate
application without adding markers to the Markdown. Select an already-applied
template again to force a reapply—for example, after manually removing its
section. The built-in **Workday timebox** template remains opt-in like every
configured template.

> **Security:** Command templates are disabled unless
> `templates.allow_commands = true`. Enabling them runs explicitly configured
> programs with your user account's filesystem and network permissions. They
> receive a minimal environment and are limited to 10 seconds and 1 MiB of
> output, but they are not sandboxed and can still read or modify `~/.sp`. Only
> configure commands you fully trust.

## Editor support

`sp` resolves the editor via `$EDITOR`, then `$VISUAL`, then
platform-specific fallbacks (vim, nvim, nano, micro, emacs, code,
etc.).

```sh
export EDITOR=vim
export EDITOR="code --wait"
```

**Caveat:** GUI editors that fork-and-detach (VS Code without
`--wait`, Sublime, Atom) will return immediately when invoked from
inside the TUI and look broken — `tea.ExecProcess` waits on the
launched process. For those, stick with bare `sp` (the synchronous
path keeps the original GUI polling loop).

## Data storage

Scratchpads live in `~/.sp/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`. Each file holds the
date, content (raw markdown), applied-template metadata, and creation / modified
timestamps.

Saves write and sync a private temporary file in the same directory before
replacing the note. On Unix, replacement is atomic and the containing directory
is synced afterward. If that last sync fails, the error explicitly reports that
the note **was replaced**, but its survival across a system crash could not be
confirmed; it does not imply that the old version was restored. Other platforms
use Go's `os.Rename` without a directory-sync or atomic-replacement guarantee.

This is not concurrent-edit protection: two instances editing the same day can
still overwrite each other's changes. Atomic replacement prevents partial files,
not stale edits.
